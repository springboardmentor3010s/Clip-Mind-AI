# ClipMind AI — Project Milestones

This document tracks the execution of all project milestones as outlined in the initial project requirements.

## Milestone 1: Week 1 & 2 — Project Initialization & Core Setup
**Status:** Completed

- **Design & Architecture:** Designed the system architecture featuring a split database design (PostgreSQL for relational data, MongoDB for document storage). UI wireframes and workflow planning were completed for the Next.js frontend.
- **Environment Setup:** Initialized the Next.js app and the FastAPI Python backend.
- **Authentication:** Implemented JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (Content Creator, Educator, Learner, Administrator).
- **Video Upload:** Built the video upload workflow allowing both local `.mp4` uploads and YouTube link parsing.

## Milestone 2: Week 3 & 4 — Transcript Generation & AI Summarization
**Status:** Completed

- **Speech-to-Text:** Integrated high-speed Whisper AI models (via Groq API) to transcribe uploaded videos or extracted audio chunks.
- **Transcript Management:** Transcripts are generated automatically in the background and stored in MongoDB.
- **AI Summarization:** Implemented advanced NLP prompts to generate:
  - Short summaries (Brief overviews)
  - Detailed, comprehensive summaries
  - Educational study guides and quizzes (for the Educator role)

## Milestone 3: Week 5 & 6 — Key Moments Detection & Analytics
**Status:** Completed

- **Timestamp Extraction:** Built logic to detect important segments in the video and extract precise timestamps.
- **Interactive UI:** The frontend allows users to click on a timestamp to jump directly to that point in the video player.
- **Keyword Extraction:** Integrated NLP techniques to extract trending keywords from transcripts.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Developed a comprehensive analytics page displaying metrics (Total Videos, Total Watch Time, Processed Hours) and visualized top trending keywords using Recharts.

## Milestone 4: Week 7 & 8 — Testing, Deployment & Documentation
**Status:** Completed

- **Testing & Validation:** Developed a `pytest` suite for the backend and a Jupyter Notebook (`evaluation.ipynb`) to benchmark AI latency and summary accuracy.
- **Optimization:** Moved intensive AI processing (transcription, summarization) into FastAPI `BackgroundTasks` to ensure high responsiveness.
- **Deployment:** Containerized the entire application using Docker. Deployed both the frontend and backend to the Render cloud platform.
- **Documentation:** Prepared complete architectural and technical documentation (this folder).
